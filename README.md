# DSGVO-Crawler

crawler.py is a Python script that implements a web crawler or spider. It starts by taking a list of URLs as input and then iteratively crawls the web by visiting each URL, extracting any links that are found on the page, and adding those links to the list of URLs to be crawled next. The script also extracts other useful information from the web pages, such as the title and the text content.

main.py is another Python script that makes use of crawler.py to perform a specific task. Depending on the specific implementation, it may use the web crawler to collect data from a certain set of websites, or to perform some kind of analysis on the data collected by the crawler. For example, it might use the data to build a machine learning model, generate statistics, or perform some other kind of computation.

Overall, both scripts work together to provide a way to automatically collect and analyze data from the web, which can be incredibly useful in a variety of contexts.

# Installation

To use these scripts, you must have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from the official website:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can download the scripts from this repository. You can either download the ZIP file or clone the repository using Git. To clone the repository, you can use the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSGVO-Crawler.git
```
After you have downloaded the scripts, you can run them from the command line using the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will execute the main.py script and begin the crawling process. If you want to specify a different set of URLs to crawl, you can modify the code in main.py accordingly.

# Usage

To use these scripts, you will need to modify the code to suit your specific needs. In particular, you will need to specify the set of URLs that you want to crawl, as well as any additional data that you want to extract from the web pages. You can do this by modifying the code in main.py and crawler.py.

Once you have modified the code to suit your needs, you can run the scripts from the command line using the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will execute the main.py script and begin the crawling process. The script will output the data that it collects to the console, and you can then process the data further as needed.
